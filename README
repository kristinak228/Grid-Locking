My deadlock prevention strategy was to use a 2d array of locks, composed of either pthread mutexes or Windows HANDLEs, which I would use when locking the individual cells or the rows. 

I also used single mutex locks to lock critical sections of code. This includes things like incrementing and decrementing the threads_left variable and locking places where my threads needed to obtain more than one lock at a time.

In this way I could prevent deadlock by forcing threads not to hold onto one lock while waiting for another, this strategy worked to fix the deadlocking issue I ran into.
